# Face-Recognition-and-Verification
In this project i implemented 2 mini porjects with face recognition and face verification using Keras. Many of the ideas presented here are from FaceNet and also DeepFace.
Face recognition problems commonly fall into two categories:
- Face Verification - "is this the claimed person?". For example, at some airports, you can pass through customs by letting a system scan your passport and then verifying that you (the person carrying the passport) are the correct person. A mobile phone that unlocks using your face is also using face verification. This is a 1:1 matching problem.
- Face Recognition - "who is this person?". For example, the video lecture showed a face recognition video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wr4rx0Spihs) of Baidu employees entering the office without needing to otherwise identify themselves. This is a 1:K matching problem.
